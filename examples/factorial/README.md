There you can see factorial.c file that takes factorial default = 5

In the end of file "logfile.txt" you can see this factorial:
```
instruction SW : 
 rd_ = 15 rs1_ = 8 rs2_ = 15
 imm_ = 4294967276
*--------------------------------------------------* 
 pc = 100 next_pc = 104
...
REG_08 = 196539
REG_15 = 120
...
*--------------------------------------------------* 
```
that will save in memory REG_15 = 120 this is desired value
```
5! = 120
```
